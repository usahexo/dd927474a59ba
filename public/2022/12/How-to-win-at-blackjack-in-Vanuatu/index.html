Blackjack is a casino game that is traditionally played with cards, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over.</p>
<p>If you’re new to the game, don’t worry – we’re here to help. In this article, we’ll teach you how to play blackjack in Vanuatu, and give you some tips on how to win.

<h1 id="The-basics-of-blackjack"><a href="#The-basics-of-blackjack" class="headerlink" title="The basics of blackjack"></a>The basics of blackjack</h1><p>Before we get into specific tips on how to win at blackjack, let’s take a quick look at the basics of the game. In blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face-up, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player can then choose whether to take another card (known as ‘hitting’) or stick with what they’ve got (known as ‘standing’). If their total equals 21 after taking another card, they have ‘blackjacked’ and automatically win.</p>
<p>If the player goes over 21, they bust and lose regardless of what the dealer has. The dealer also has two cards, but one is face down and one is face up. The aim of the game for the dealer is therefore to hit until they reach 17 or more, at which point they must stand. If the dealer busts, all players still in the game win automatically.</p>
