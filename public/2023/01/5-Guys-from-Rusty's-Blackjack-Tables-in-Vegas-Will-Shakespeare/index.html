This game is blackjack, and it can be found in most large gambling establishments around the city. At these tables players can hope to win big payouts if they are lucky, but the house always has an edge.</p>
<p>There are some people who have managed to overcome the odds and make a fortune playing blackjack in Vegas. One such group of individuals are the 5 Guys from Rusty’s Blackjack Tables. These guys have been playing together at the same table in Sin City for over 10 years, and during that time they have won millions of dollars.</p>
<p>How have they done it? By using a combination of skill, luck, and strategy they have been able to beat the casino at its own game. And while their methods may not work for everyone, they provide a great example of how to win at blackjack.</p>
<p>The first thing that the 5 Guys do is choose a table that is favorable to them. This means finding one with a low house edge, and one that has dealt out lots of winning hands in the past. They also make sure to limit their betting to amounts that they are comfortable losing. This way they can stay in the game even when they are having a bad run of luck.</p>
<p>Next, they use basic blackjack strategy to make their plays. This involves making sure that they always take insurance when the dealer shows an ace, never splitting 10s, and so on. By following these guidelines they give themselves the best chance of winning each hand.</p>
<p>Finally, they rely on Lady Luck to bail them out when necessary. No matter how good your strategy is, you can’t always win at blackjack. That’s why it’s important to keep your chip stack healthy so that you can ride out any bad runs. And if Lady Luck does shine on you then you could end up walking away from the table a millionaire.</p>
<p>So if you’re heading to Vegas and want to try your luck at blackjack, be sure to learn from the 5 Guys from Rusty’s Blackjack Tables. Their strategies will help you increase your chances of winning, and maybe you’ll be able to join their ranks as one of Vegas’ top blackjack players</p>
<h1 id="Shakespeare-buffs-hit-the-tables-in-Vegas"><a href="#Shakespeare-buffs-hit-the-tables-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Shakespeare buffs hit the tables in Vegas"></a>Shakespeare buffs hit the tables in Vegas</h1><p>William Shakespeare devotees descended on the tables in Las Vegas this past weekend to celebrate the works of the Bard. The conference, hosted by the casino Wynn, was three days of panels, classes and workshops on all things Shakespeare.</p>
<p>“It’s great to see so many people passionate about Shakespeare,” said Patrick Dowd, Director of Learning at Wynn. “The conference is a way to bring together scholars and enthusiasts and give them a chance to learn more about the Bard and his work.”</p>
<p>The conference kicked off with a keynote from prominent Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt, who spoke about how the Bard still speaks to us today. Other panels focused on topics such as staging Shakespeare, using technology in teaching Shakespeare and the changing landscape of Shakespeare studies.</p>
<p>For many attendees, the highlight of the conference was getting to see performances of some of Shakespeare’s most celebrated plays. These included As You Like It, Macbeth and A Midsummer Night’s Dream.</p>
<p>“It’s really amazing how relevant Shakespeare still is, even 400 years after he wrote his plays,” said attendee Peggy Perlstein. “I can’t wait to learn more about him and his work.”</p>
<h1 id="Men-of-Mystery-Who-were-the-guys-at-Rusty’s-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas"><a href="#Men-of-Mystery-Who-were-the-guys-at-Rusty’s-blackjack-tables-in-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Men of Mystery: Who were the guys at Rusty’s blackjack tables in Vegas?"></a>Men of Mystery: Who were the guys at Rusty’s blackjack tables in Vegas?</h1><p>Ask any group of seasoned blackjack players about the “guys at Rusty’s table” in Las Vegas and you’ll get a variety of different answers. Some will say that these players were complete pros who never made a mistake. Others will tell you that they were always lucky and never lost a hand. And still others will say that they were just lucky amateurs who got lucky one night and won big.</p>
<p>But who were these guys really? Were they exceptional blackjack players who had mastered the game? Were they simply lucky amateurs who hit it big one night? Or were they something else entirely?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we need to take a closer look at what happened at Rusty’s table. First of all, we need to rule out the possibility that these players were simply lucky amateurs. While it’s possible that some of them may have been lucky, the fact is that blackjack is a game of skill and chance, and it’s impossible to win every hand. So if these players were truly lucky amateurs, they would have eventually lost money in the long run.</p>
<p>Next, we need to look at their playing history. If these guys had been winning big at blackjack for years, then it’s likely that they were skilled players. However, if this was their only big win, then it’s more likely that they were just lucky amateurs.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to look at the circumstances of their win. If they won big on a single night by getting lucky with their cards, then it’s more likely that they were just lucky amateurs. But if they consistently won hands against much better players, then it’s more likely that they were skilled pros.</p>
<p>So who were the guys at Rusty’s table in Las Vegas? The answer is probably a little bit of both – some of them may have been skilled pros while others may have just gotten lucky one night. But either way, they sure gave the other blackjack players in Vegas something to talk about!</p>

<p>The cast features some of the best local talent, including Laurence Fishburne Jr. and Christopher Young. The show runs from September 9th to October 2nd at the intimate theater on Sahara Avenue.</p>
<p>It has been centuries since Shakespeare wrote his great tragedies, and it is exciting to see one being performed in Las Vegas. This production is sure to get your pulse racing as you follow the story of Prince Hamlet and his quest for revenge.</p>

Rusty recently hit the jackpot at the blackjack tables and is eager to share his story.</p>
<p>After years of planning and saving, Rusty was finally able to make the trip to Sin City. He started by playing penny slots, but soon graduated to table games. He played blackjack for a few hours on Monday night and was up over $300.</p>
<p>Tuesday was a different story - Rusty lost over $200 at the blackjack tables. But he didn’t give up, and Wednesday he hit it big.</p>
<p>In the early morning hours, Rusty had a $1,000 winning streak that put him in positive territory for the trip. He cashed out and celebrated with a few beers before calling it a night.</p>
<p>While luck definitely played a role in Rusty’s success, he also made some smart choices. He avoided high-stakes games and stuck to basic strategy guidelines.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to hit it big in Vegas, Rusty’s story is a great example of how it can be done. Just make sure you come prepared and don’t gamble away your life savings!</p>
