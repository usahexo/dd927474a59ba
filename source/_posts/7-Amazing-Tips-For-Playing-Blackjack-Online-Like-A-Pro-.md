#  Surprising Tips for Beating Blackjack Online

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Millions of people play it every year in live casinos and online. If you're one of those people, you'll want to read this article. It contains some surprising tips for beating blackjack that you may not have heard before.

Tip #1: Split Pairs When Possible

One of the biggest mistakes that players make is sticking with their original hand when they could be splitting their pairs instead. For example, if you are dealt two eights, you should split them up and play each hand as if it were a new game. This increases your chances of winning because you now have twice as many chances to get a good hand.

Tip #2: Take Advantage of Doubling Down

Another option that you have in blackjack is doubling down. This means that you can double your bet after seeing your first two cards. However, you can only do this if your cards total 9, 10 or 11. This is a great way to increase your profits because it allows you to bet more money on a hand that has a good chance of winning.

Tip #3: Stay Away from Hard Totals

One strategy that some players use is to stay away from hard totals (hands that total 12 through 16). This is because these hands are more likely to lose than win. Instead, try to focus on soft totals (hands that total 2 through 6) because these are much more likely to win.
