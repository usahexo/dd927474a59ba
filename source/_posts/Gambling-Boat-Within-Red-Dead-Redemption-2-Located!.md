#  Gambling Boat Within Red Dead Redemption 2 Located!

Gambling boats are located all throughout the map of Red Dead Redemption 2, and one such boat is located right within the borders of West Elizabeth.

This gambling boat is found in the southeast region of the map, just east of Bluewater Marsh and directly south of Saint Denis. It's a small, white boat that's easy enough to spot from a distance.

When you arrive at the boat, you'll find that it's in use by a small group of men. You can approach them or simply walk around to the other side of the boat to find the entrance.

Once you're inside, you'll find a few different gaming tables. There's Blackjack, Poker and Three Card Monte. The games themselves are pretty simple to play - just watch the on-screen prompts and follow the directions.

The jackpot for this gambling boat is $500, but it can be difficult to win if you're not familiar with the games. You can also gamble away your entire fortune if you're not careful, so make sure you know what you're doing before starting to play.
