#  Shakespeare buffs hit the tables in Vegas

William Shakespeare devotees descended on the tables in Las Vegas this past weekend to celebrate the works of the Bard. The conference, hosted by the casino Wynn, was three days of panels, classes and workshops on all things Shakespeare.

“It’s great to see so many people passionate about Shakespeare,” said Patrick Dowd, Director of Learning at Wynn. “The conference is a way to bring together scholars and enthusiasts and give them a chance to learn more about the Bard and his work.”

The conference kicked off with a keynote from prominent Shakespeare scholar Stephen Greenblatt, who spoke about how the Bard still speaks to us today. Other panels focused on topics such as staging Shakespeare, using technology in teaching Shakespeare and the changing landscape of Shakespeare studies.

For many attendees, the highlight of the conference was getting to see performances of some of Shakespeare’s most celebrated plays. These included As You Like It, Macbeth and A Midsummer Night’s Dream.

“It’s really amazing how relevant Shakespeare still is, even 400 years after he wrote his plays,” said attendee Peggy Perlstein. “I can’t wait to learn more about him and his work.”

#  Men of Mystery: Who were the guys at Rusty's blackjack tables in Vegas?

Ask any group of seasoned blackjack players about the "guys at Rusty's table" in Las Vegas and you'll get a variety of different answers. Some will say that these players were complete pros who never made a mistake. Others will tell you that they were always lucky and never lost a hand. And still others will say that they were just lucky amateurs who got lucky one night and won big.

But who were these guys really? Were they exceptional blackjack players who had mastered the game? Were they simply lucky amateurs who hit it big one night? Or were they something else entirely?

To answer this question, we need to take a closer look at what happened at Rusty's table. First of all, we need to rule out the possibility that these players were simply lucky amateurs. While it's possible that some of them may have been lucky, the fact is that blackjack is a game of skill and chance, and it's impossible to win every hand. So if these players were truly lucky amateurs, they would have eventually lost money in the long run.

Next, we need to look at their playing history. If these guys had been winning big at blackjack for years, then it's likely that they were skilled players. However, if this was their only big win, then it's more likely that they were just lucky amateurs.

Finally, we need to look at the circumstances of their win. If they won big on a single night by getting lucky with their cards, then it's more likely that they were just lucky amateurs. But if they consistently won hands against much better players, then it's more likely that they were skilled pros.

So who were the guys at Rusty's table in Las Vegas? The answer is probably a little bit of both – some of them may have been skilled pros while others may have just gotten lucky one night. But either way, they sure gave the other blackjack players in Vegas something to talk about!
