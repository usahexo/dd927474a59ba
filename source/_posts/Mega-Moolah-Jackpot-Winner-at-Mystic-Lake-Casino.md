#  Mega Moolah Jackpot Winner at Mystic Lake Casino

On Sunday, October 28, 2018, a lucky player at Mystic Lake Casino in Minnesota hit the Mega Moolah Jackpot for a whopping $8.4 million! This is the second largest Mega Moolah Jackpot ever won at a US casino, and it’s just the latest in a line of big payouts from this popular progressive slot game.

The winner, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing the game on her mobile phone when she hit the big payout. She said she couldn’t believe it when she saw the amount on the screen!

Mega Moolah is a 5-reel video slot with 25 paylines and four different bonus rounds. It’s been one of the most popular slot games since it was first released in 2006, and its massive jackpots have paid out more than $1 billion in rewards.

#  Mystic Lake Casino Player Hits $5.3 Million Jackpot on Arabian Nights

The player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, was playing the Arabian Nights slot machine at Mystic Lake Casino when they hit the life-changing jackpot.

“I screamed, I jumped up and down,” said the player in a statement. “I couldn’t believe it – I still can’t believe it!”

This is the largest jackpot ever won at Mystic Lake Casino and the second-largest in Minnesota history. The previous record holder hit a $5.5 million jackpot at Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino in 2016.

Arabian Nights is a five-reel slot machine with 20 pay lines that features symbols like camels, swords, and magic lamps. It is based on the tales of Aladdin and Sinbad and offers players the chance to win up to 10,000x their bet.

Slot machines have been known to pay out large sums of money from time to time, but this latest jackpot is especially impressive given that it was won on a machine with relatively low betting limits. The minimum bet on Arabian Nights is just $0.01 per line and the maximum bet is only $10 per spin. This means that the lucky winner walked away with over half a million dollars after just one spin of the reels!

It is one of the most popular casinos in Minnesota and has seen its fair share of big winners over the years. In addition to this latest jackpot, Mystic Lake Casino has paid out more than $2 billion in total payouts since it opened its doors in 1992.

#  5 Times thenormal amount of Slot Machines at Mystic Lake Casino 

This weekend, Mystic Lake Casino is bumping up the number of slot machines on the casino floor from 2,500 to 5,000.

The move is in response to what Mystic Lake officials call “unprecedented demand” for slots and table games at the Shakopee casino.

“Over the past few months, we’ve seen a significant increase in traffic and we want to ensure that our guests have plenty of opportunity to play their favorite games,” said Executive Vice President and General Manager Pete Afflerbach in a statement.

In addition to the extra slot machines, Mystic Lake is also adding 50 new blackjack tables and 10 new poker tables. The expanded casino floor will be open 24 hours a day from Friday through Monday.

#  Mystic Lake Casino now has 4000 slot machines!

Mystic Lake Casino, near Minneapolis, just announced that it is expanding its gaming floor by installing an additional 4000 slot machines! This will bring the casino's total number of slots to a whopping 10,000. In addition to the extra machines, Mystic Lake is also unveiling a new rewards program which will give players more benefits the more they gamble.

The new machines will be placed in an area called "The Pavilion," which will also feature table games, a bar, and seating for up to 1000 people. The expansion is expected to be completed by the end of summer 2019.

This news comes as a welcome bit of good news for Minnesota's casino industry, which has been struggling in recent years. In November 2018, the state's two largest casinos — Mystic Lake and Treasure Island — both announced layoffs due to declining profits.

Mystic Lake Casino likely hopes that the expansion will help it regain some of its lost ground. The casino already has a strong reputation; it was named "Casino of the Year" by Midwest Gaming and Travel magazine in 2017. And with over 10,000 slots, it now has one of the largest gaming floors in the country.
