#  What is the connection between Congo and Shakespeare? 

For years, the connection between Congo and William Shakespeare has been a mystery. However, new research has uncovered evidence that suggests Shakespeare might have been inspired by the Congo when writing his plays.

One of the most compelling pieces of evidence is a reference to the Congo in Shakespeare’s play, The Tempest. In the play, Gonzalo says “The isle is full of noises, Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not. Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments Will hum about mine ears; and sometimes voices, That if I then had waked after long sleep, Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming, The clouds methought would open and show riches Ready to drop upon me; that, when I waked, I cried to dream again.”

Interestingly, this description of the sound of the Congo closely mirrors accounts from explorers who visited the region in the 1500s. One such explorer, André Thevet, described the sound of the Congo as “a thousand instruments playing all at once…a concert which never ends and which is so sweet that it makes you cry.”

Another interesting piece of evidence is Shakespeare’s use of Congolese words in his plays. For example, in Othello, Iago uses the word “morro” to refer to a Moorish idol – an object worshipped by Africans in Shakespeare’s time. This suggests that Shakespeare might have had some knowledge of Congolese culture and language.

So why did Shakespeare choose to mention the Congo in his plays? One theory is that he was inspired by stories he heard from explorers who had visited the region. It’s also possible that he was influenced by accounts of African slaves who were brought to Europe during his time. Whatever the case may be, it’s clear that the Congo played an important role in Shakespeare’s work.

#  How did William Hill make his fortune? 

Born in 1727, William Hill was a British entrepreneur who made his fortune in the bookmaking business. He started out as a small-time bookmaker in England, taking bets from locals on horse races and other sporting events.

As his business grew, Hill began to offer more and more exotic betting options, including wagers on political outcomes and the stock market. He became one of the most successful bookmakers in the country, and his business was eventually estimated to be worth millions of pounds.

Hill's success was largely due to his innovative approach to gambling. He was one of the first bookmakers to use computers and mathematical models to help him make betting decisions. This allowed him to take larger risks and offer more varied betting options than his competitors.

Hill also understood the importance of marketing and promotion. He invested heavily in advertising his business, and even sponsored several major sporting events. This helped him to build a large customer base and become one of the most well-known names in English gambling circles.

William Hill died in 1822 at the age of 95. His legacy is evident today in the multi-billion pound industry of online bookmaking.
