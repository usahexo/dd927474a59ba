#  Gun Slinger Game Officially Begins at Mohegan Sun Casino!

It’s all systems go at the Mohegan Sun Casino in Connecticut as the Gun Slinger game begins! The high-stakes, action-packed game is drawing players from all over the country, eager to put their luck to the test and see if they can walk away with some serious cash.

Gun Slinger is a variation of blackjack that features a number of side bets, which can increase the excitement (and the potential payout) of the game significantly. Players are dealt two cards face up, and then have the opportunity to take additional cards in order to try and get as close to 21 as possible. The player who scores closest to 21 without going over wins the hand.

In Gun Slinger, however, there are also a number of side bets that can be made. These include wagers on whether or not the player will bust (go over 21), whether or not they will get a blackjack (an Ace and a 10), and how many cards the player will take before busting. There are also wagers on specific card combinations, such as two pair or three of a kind.

The odds vary on each of these side bets, but they offer players an extra chance to win big – especially if they hit one of the more lucrative payouts. For example, a blackjack pays out 3:2 on your bet, while getting three of a kind pays out 100:1. There’s even a special bonus payout for getting four of a kind!
