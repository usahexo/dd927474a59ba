#  Why Aren't a Monegasque Play at Typically the Casino Microgaming Plank? 

The Principality of Monaco offers an array of attractions to visitors, including a casino. Operated by the well-known gaming software provider Microgaming, the casino is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Monaco. However, there is one glaring omission from the casino—a Monegasque game.

Monegasques are citizens of Monaco, and as such, should enjoy playing games with other Monegasques at their home casino. Yet, when one looks at the Microgaming Plank at the Casino de Monaco, there are no Monegasque games offered. This is despite the fact that other nationalities are well-represented, with games from countries such as Canada, Australia, and Sweden.

There are several possible explanations for this discrepancy. One possibility is that Microgaming does not have a Monegasque game offering. However, this seems unlikely as Microgaming has a long history of developing games specifically for local markets. A more likely explanation is that the Casino de Monaco has not contracted with Microgaming to offer Monegasque games.

This lack of representation is particularly perplexing given that the Casino de Monaco offers other local games, such as French and Italian roulette. It would appear that Monegasques are not being given the same opportunity as other nationalities to enjoy their own games at their home casino. This may be due to a lack of awareness or interest on the part of the Casino de Monaco in contracting with Microgaming to offer Monegasque games.

Whatever the reason for this exclusion, it is time for the Casino de Monaco to rectify this situation and give Monegasques the opportunity to play their own games at their home casino.
