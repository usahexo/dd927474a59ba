A new study published by the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry has shown that skills-based training can help reduce problem gambling behaviors. The research, conducted at the University of Alberta in Canada, found that a cognitive-behavioural program designed to improve participants’ skills in resisting temptation and managing emotions was more effective than standard treatment at reducing problem gambling severity and frequency.

“Most people with a gambling problem don’t get help,” said Dr. Stephanie Butt, the study’s lead author. “This research shows that there are treatments available that work, and it’s important that people know about them. Treatment is most effective when it is tailored to the individual, so this type of program may be particularly good for people who struggle with impulse control and emotional regulation.”

The study involved 104 adult problem gamblers who were randomly assigned to either the cognitive-behavioural program or standard treatment. Participants in the cognitive-behavioural program received individualized coaching on how to improve their skills in areas such as resisting temptation, managing emotions, and planning ahead. They also completed activities designed to increase their awareness of how thoughts, feelings, and environment contribute to problem gambling behaviour.

At the end of the 12-week treatment period, participants in the cognitive-behavioural program had significantly lower scores on a measure of problem gambling severity than those in the standard treatment group. They were also half as likely to experience severe problems with gambling during the follow-up period six months later.

These findings suggest that skills-based training may be an effective way to help people with a gambling problem reduce their risk of relapse. If you or someone you know is struggling with a gambling problem, seek professional help. There are treatments available that can help you recover and manage your gambling behaviours safely and effectively.
