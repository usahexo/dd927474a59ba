#  What style of photography do Colossal Weddings specialize in?

They capture the natural moments and emotions of your wedding day as it unfolds, without staging or directing your guests.

#  How long have they been photographing weddings? 

When it comes to wedding photography, there are a few questions that couples tend to ask in order to get to know their photographer better. How long have they been photographing weddings? What’s their style? What kind of equipment do they use? But by far, the question that is asked most often is: how much do you charge?

While price is certainly an important factor when choosing a wedding photographer, it’s not the only one. You also want to make sure you choose somebody who has the same vision as you and who will be able to capture your big day the way you imagine it. 

So how do you go about finding the right photographer for your wedding? Look for somebody with plenty of experience. They should have a portfolio full of beautiful images from previous weddings, which will give you a good idea of their style. Make sure they use quality equipment and that they are comfortable shooting in all types of lighting situations. And finally, ask them how much they charge – but don’t necessarily choose the cheapest option. Remember, you get what you pay for!

#  What sets them apart from other wedding photographers? 

When it comes to wedding photography, there are a few things that set apart the great photographers from the rest. 

First and foremost, shooting a wedding is all about anticipation. Photographers who can capture the emotion and excitement of the day while it’s happening are definitely worth their weight in gold. Great wedding photographers have the ability to be in the right place at the right time, capturing all the important moments as they unfold.

Another thing that sets great photographers apart is their ability to tell a story with their images. Wedding photos should not just be a bunch of pretty pictures; they should capture the feeling of the day and document the story of the wedding. Great photographers have a knack for taking beautiful photos that also tell a story.

Finally, great wedding photographers know how to work well with couples. They understand that every couple is different, and they take the time to get to know each couple in order to capture their unique personality in their photos. They also work closely with couples during the planning process, so that they know what type of photos they want on their wedding day.

If you’re looking for a photographer who can capture the emotion and excitement of your wedding day, tell your story through images, and work well with couples, then look no further than a great wedding photographer.

#  What is the average turnaround time for images? 

There is no definitive answer to this question as it can depend on a variety of factors, such as the size and complexity of the image, the level of detail required, the software used, and the skill level of the technician. However, according to a recent study, the average turnaround time for basic photo editing services is three business days.

For more complex tasks, such as retouching or rebuilding an image from scratch, the turnaround time can be significantly longer. In some cases, it may take weeks or even months to complete a project. It is therefore important to discuss your specific requirements with the service provider before you place an order.

When it comes to image turnaround times, there are two important things to keep in mind: first, don't wait until the last minute to submit your order; and second, always allow for extra time in case there are any unforeseen delays. By planning ahead and allowing for potential delays, you can avoid unnecessary stress and ensure that your images are processed in a timely manner.

#  Do they offer any other services such as photo booths or videography?
