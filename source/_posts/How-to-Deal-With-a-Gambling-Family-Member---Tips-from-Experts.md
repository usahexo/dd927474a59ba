#  How to Cope with a Gambler in the Family 

The experience of having a gambler in the family can be painful and frustrating. It can feel like you are constantly walking on eggshells, never knowing when they are going to have a gambling relapse and what that might mean for the family. You may feel like you are parenting a ticking time bomb. So, how do you cope with a gambler in the family?

There is no one answer that will work for everyone, but here are some things to keep in mind:

1. Understand that gambling addiction is a real addiction 
Just like with any other addiction, there is not much you can do to make someone stop gambling if they don't want to. Gambling addiction is a real disease that should be treated with the same level of seriousness as drugs or alcohol addiction. Don't try to "fix" your loved one or force them into treatment; that will only drive them further away.

2. Establish boundaries 
One way to help cope with a gambler in the family is to establish boundaries. This means setting rules about how much money they can spend, what kind of gambling is allowed (e.g., no online gambling), and how often they are allowed to gamble. These rules should be discussed and agreed upon by all members of the family, and they should be enforced consistently.

3. Seek support 
Coping with a gambler in the family can be very difficult, and it's important to have people you can talk to who understand what you're going through. There are many support groups available for families affected by gambling addiction, as well as online forums where you can find information and advice from others in similar situations.

4. Be patient 
It may take time for your loved one to get help for their gambling addiction, if they decide to seek help at all. Be patient and supportive during this process; relapse is common among people trying to recover from gambling addiction.

#  How to Help a Gambling Addict in the Family 

Are you worried about a loved one who may have a gambling addiction? Here are some steps you can take to help them:

1. Talk to your loved one about their gambling. Let them know that you are concerned and want to help.

2. Help them develop a plan to deal with their addiction. This may include quitting gambling cold turkey, or setting limits on how much money they can gamble each week.

3. Make sure they have support from family and friends. Gambling addiction can be isolating, so it’s important for your loved one to have a support network they can rely on.

4. Stay positive and supportive. Remember that recovery is not always easy, but your loved one can do it with your help.

These boundaries will help keep your loved one safe and accountable.

It is important not to enable your loved one’s behavior by giving them money to gamble with or by making excuses for their gambling habits. This will only make it harder for them to recover from their addiction. Instead, support them in their recovery without enabling their harmful behavior.

6. Offer emotional support during tough times.

It is inevitable that there will be times when your loved one experiences setbacks in their recovery journey. Offering emotional support during these tough times can be crucial in helping them stay on track towards recovery.
